/**
 * Intro:
 * OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programing,
 * Is one of the popular programming approaches, and its intended to organize the code inside the classes.
 * So OOP is based on `Classes`,
 * The purpose of creating `Class` is to create objects from it (later).
 *
 * The point (المغزى من) of OOP is to build systems with fully simulation of their objects.
 * E.g: Harri (software company) planning to build restaurant system in OOP approach,
 * in planning stage we have to detect the notable entities in restaurant
 * like `Chefs`, `Meals`, `Customers`, `Orders`, ..etc.
 * & then build classes for all these notable entities,
 * later we will make copies of these classes and fill the needed data for them in the form of objects.
 *
 * We can liken `Class` to `Blueprint` and
 * the `Object` liken the `Model` with the actual dimensions of Blueprint.
 * So we can make many `Objects` of a `Class` Like we can Make many `Models` of a `Blueprint`.
 *
 * What is `Class` (as developer perspective) ?
     * Class is a set of attributes & behaviors
     * Attributes (and we can call them as Properties) are holding data (like the variables in procedural scripts)
     * Behaviors are contains the logic (code) of class (like the functions in procedural scripts)
 *
 * Creating object of class is the process of making copy of `Class` (Blueprint) and
 * convert it to actual object (actual related data, and behaviors of class).
